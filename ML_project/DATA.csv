2.0,"quality of Cloth is not good. Item is not as described. The quality of the item should be described in description as it is...So I think you should be more careful about these things...Which makes it easier for customers to trust you. If you don't fix that, then customers will not be able to trust you from next time...‚òπÔ∏è 4/10"
