# WinPro: A Website for Selecting Winning Products in E-commerce Through Review Analysis

## Overview ðŸš€
Online shopping presents a vast array of choices, making it increasingly challenging for both sellers and buyers. Sellers, especially those utilizing cash-on-delivery (COD) networks, face heightened financial risks due to manual selection processes. Traditional methods demand substantial time and resources, necessitating a smarter alternative. This research introduces a methodology enriched with sentiment analysis to streamline product selection. By integrating sentiment analysis with machine learning, it addresses sellers' unique challenges and enhances decision-making precision in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.

## Key highlights : 

- **Data Collection**: Utilized a vast dataset of Amazon's fashion reviews to train our model, ensuring comprehensive coverage and relevance.
  
- **Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing**: Employed meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to refine textual data, including the removal of punctuation and stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization, enhancing the effectiveness of sentiment analysis. 

- **Feature Extraction**: Implemented advanced text processing methodologies to convert fashion reviews into numerical vectors, leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF and n-grams to capture nuanced insights.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted insightful visualizations and analyses to unravel key patterns and distributions within the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of underlying trends.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Explored a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, to discern the most suitable approach for classifying Amazon fashion reviews accurately.

- **Evaluation**: Employed rigorous evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to meticulously assess model performance. Leveraged grid search techniques to optimize model parameters, ultimately selecting SVM as the top-performing classifier for our task.

- **Deployment**: Created a user-friendly website with HTML, CSS, and Flask, offering intuitive design and enabling input of Amazon product URLs.
